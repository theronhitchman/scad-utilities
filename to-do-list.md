  - flattening
  - create a range
  - reverse

## Vector operations

  - <del>dot product</del>  _already exists_ use u*v
  - cross product
  - plot a vector of a given color with given foot and direction
  - transformation between 3d and 4d representations and back

## transformation Operations

  - projective transformations of objects

## Parametric Curves

  - parametric curve given input functions, interval of definition, and number of mesh points
  - Frenet framing
  - tubed curve representation :: smoothing for when curvature is large?

## Parametric Surfaces

  - surface as a set of triangles from input functions,
    a box for input region definition, and numbers of subdivisions
  - thickening for surface
  - surface for other regions of definition

## Splines

  - ??
